// coop: Pokopia's Link Play "Local Connection" between our native builds (research/06 §5, docs/coop-step1.md, docs/coop-step1c.md). MIT, our own code.
// One portable C11 module every port's HLE layer calls: `ldn` (the nn::ldn state machine and the 0x480 NetworkInfo), `vnet` (the game's UDP
// sockets on a virtual 169.254.S.0/24), `mpnet` (the real transport: a star of TCP control links around the host plus UDP for game datagrams)
// and `disc` (DNS-SD on the LAN: Apple dns_sd, Windows DnsService*, nothing elsewhere).
// BSD sockets (macOS, iOS, Android, Linux) or Winsock (Windows). Every entry point is thread-safe; each node has one lock and one I/O thread.
// Peers are loopback or LAN addresses (step 1c), configured by DM_COOP / DM_COOP_TCP / DM_UID; internet play (step 1d, docs/coop-step1d.md) is an
// explicit opt-in (DM_COOP_INTERNET=1): every link proves the host's room code and every frame and datagram carries a tag (coop_auth.c), but
// nothing is encrypted. DM_COOP_RELAY names a relay players host themselves (tools/coop-relay).
